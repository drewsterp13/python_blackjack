This game is a card game where the dealer gives you two cards and as well as for himself. The goal is for you the player 
to gain the highest total number from the cards without going above 21, if you do, then you bust. When you are handed the 
cards, you then have two choices, **hit** and **stand**.

If **hit** is chosen, then you gain an additional card, after that, you will be given the choice again, and you can
**hit** again, but becareful, you might end up getting too high on the total.

If **stand** is chosen, then the dealer will display his cards, and then the cards will be compared, whoever has the highest total wins,
however, the dealer can bust. After the outcome, the game will ask if you want to play again.
